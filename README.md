# finance-calculator

Brief was to:

Build a finance calculator that accepts:

    The amount you would like to borrow (£)
    Your expected salary (£): default £25,000
    Monthly repayment percentage: default/minimum 10%

The calculator should tell you the admin fee required to borrow the money, how long it will take you to pay off and the total amount that you will have borrowed.

Requirements:

    Borrow amount between £1 and £10,000
    If borrowing above 80% (£8000) then add £500 to repayment amount
    If borrowing above 90% (£9000) then add a further £500 to repayment amount
    Display 5% of total borrowed amount as upfront admin fee
    Must be written in TypeScript
    Must use a CSS preprocessor (SCSS)
